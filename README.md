### What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
I realized how powerful JavaScript + Node.JS is in terms of string manipulations. Although, with the lack of explicit data types, a complex code can become difficult to maintain if not annotated or documented properly. JavaScript can be error prone when converting between data types. Hence, it should become my habit to document critical lines where there is heavy data manipulation and conversion so that large projects made with JavaScript can still become manageable.
